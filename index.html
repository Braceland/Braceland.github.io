    Problem Statement:

Students at UofSC need a way to find a parking spot even if they have a parking pass because they don’t have the time to waste going through a parking lot just to not have a spot.

Who is experiencing the problem?

Students and potentially some faculty

What is the problem?

It is too difficult to determine if there will be parking within the various parking lots around campus

Where does the problem present itself?

Any student lot within UofSC campus

Why does it matter?

Students could be late or miss class due to there not being enough parking
