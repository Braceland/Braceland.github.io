    Problem Statement:<br>

Students at UofSC need a way to find a parking spot even if they have a parking pass because they don’t have the time to waste going through a parking lot just to not have a spot.<br>

Who is experiencing the problem?<br>

Students and potentially some faculty<br>

What is the problem?<br>

It is too difficult to determine if there will be parking within the various parking lots around campus<br>

Where does the problem present itself?<br>

Any student lot within UofSC campus<br>

Why does it matter?<br>

Students could be late or miss class due to there not being enough parking
